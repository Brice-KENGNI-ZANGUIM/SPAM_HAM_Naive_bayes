# SPAM Detector : Na誰ve Bayes Approach

In this github you find a python script for <strong> spam detection </strong> based on a <strong> Na誰ve Bayes approach.</strong> The Na誰ve Bayes theorem try to figure out a posterior probability base on prior probabiility. An email can be consider as a set of word and base on the word composition of a previous set of email we can builb a classifier  based Na誰ve Bayes Theorem to mesure the probability that any given email is an spam or ham.

Thank to Bayes Theorem
